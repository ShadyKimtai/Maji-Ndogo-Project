Maji Ndogo Water Services - SQL Data Analysis Project (Initial Part)
Introduction
This README document covers the initial part of the SQL data analysis project related to Maji Ndogo's water services. The project is a multi-step endeavor that aims to explore and derive insights from the provided dataset using SQL queries. The dataset comprises information on employees, water sources, visits, water quality, and pollution.

This part of the project focuses on data preprocessing, employee analysis, water source analysis, visit patterns, water source quality, and pollution issues.

Project Structure
The initial part of the project is divided into several sections, each addressing specific aspects of the dataset:

Data Preprocessing:

In the beginning, we perform some data preprocessing tasks, including creating email addresses for employees and cleaning phone numbers.
Employee Analysis:

We analyze employee data to understand the distribution of employees in different towns and provinces.
Water Source Analysis:

This section explores water source data, focusing on the types of water sources, population served, and percentage of people served by each source.
Visit Patterns:

We examine visit patterns, such as the average queue times on specific days and times.
Water Source Quality:

This part focuses on the quality of water sources, specifically the cleanliness and biological contamination of water sources.
Pollution Issues:

We analyze data related to pollution in well sources, looking for inconsistencies in how well statuses are recorded.
SQL Queries
The initial part of the project includes various SQL queries that perform data analysis tasks on the provided dataset. These queries encompass data extraction, cleaning, filtering, grouping, aggregating, and joining from multiple tables.

Code
